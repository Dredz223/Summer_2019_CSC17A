Welcome 		to 			UNO!!!!!!!

**********************************************************************

Setup: The game version is for X players, ages doesn't matter. Every 
player starts with seven cards. The rest of the cards are set aside.
(This version is unable to draw new cards.) Next to the pile a space 
should be designated for a Discard Pile. The top card should be placed 
in the Discard Pile, and the game begins! Also know as the starting 
card.

Game Play: Every player views his/her cards and tries to match the 
card in the Discard Pile.

You have to match either by the number or color. For instance, if 
the Discard Pile has a red card that is an 8 you have to place either 
a red card or a card with an 8 on it. 

If the player has no matches the game moves on to the next person. 

The winner is awarded e^(1) points.
